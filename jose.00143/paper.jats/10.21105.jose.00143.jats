  <title>Summary</title>
  <p>ApplNumComp is a repository of open educational resources
  supporting an introductory course on Applied Numerical Computing.
  Topics include Git for version control, LaTeX for typesetting,
  reproducible research computing, and MATLAB and Python for high-level
  programming and scientific computing applications of solving systems
  of differential equations, estimating parameters for models using
  regression, creating publication quality figures, and developing
  graphical user interfaces. The lessons can be used collectively for a
  similar course at another institution, for independent study by an
  online learner, or for incorporation of individual lessons (modules or
  examples) into other courses that involve related topics.</p>

  <title>Statement of Need</title>
  <p>An introductory course on Applied Numerical Computing was developed
  for upper division undergraduate and graduate students interested in
  research and industrial projects involving mathematical modeling using
  computational tools. The class was designed to fill a gap distinct
  from introductory programming and numerical methods courses and was
  intended to be very practical. Graduate students new to computational
  research were the primary student group targeted for the course
  topics. We have previously detailed the course
  (<xref alt="Ford Versypt, 2019" rid="ref-FordVersypt2019" ref-type="bibr">Ford
  Versypt, 2019</xref>) and the final course project
  (<xref alt="Ruggiero et al., 2018" rid="ref-Ruggiero2018" ref-type="bibr">Ruggiero
  et al., 2018</xref>).</p>
  <p>No single textbook covers all of the topics in the Applied
  Numerical Computing course. As the course emphasized best practices
  for reproducible research computing, we sought to apply the concept to
  the course materials for a reproducible computing educational
  experience. Here, we have curated a set of open educational resources
  for others to engage with the course lessons outside of the
  institutionâ€™s learning management system and outside of the formal
  course. The main repository is organized into a set of lessons as
  Markdown-formatted text-based open-source webpages that include code
  snippets, explanatory text, reflection questions, sample solution
  software files, links to supplemental videos, related references, and
  other instructional materials. Each lesson can be considered as a
  stand alone module on a particular computational topic; however, there
  are conceptual links between some of the lessons. Many of the lessons
  include detailed MATLAB or Python coding examples, or both as in the
  case for Lesson 10: Python and MATLAB Plotting. For instance, Lesson
  13: Parameter Estimation in Python provides a worked example for
  fitting parameters to one differential equation and the solution .py
  file followed by a second example for fitting parameters to multiple
  differential equations. Related Lessons 11 and 12 provide supportive
  general information and complimentary content with examples in MATLAB.
  Documentation associated with MATLAB or Python often only shows much
  simpler examples. Open-source worked examples are limited for even
  just solving multiple differential equations simultaneously
  independently from the parameter estimation. The full list of lessons
  is available

  Other supporting materials include a list of

  <p>Our experiences with the course and materials have been positive.
  Over the 5 course offerings, 63 graduate students and 27 undergraduate
  students took the course. The students were majoring in the following
  12 fields: chemical engineering, mechanical engineering, aerospace
  engineering, civil engineering, environmental engineering, chemistry,
  plant and soil sciences, mathematics, electrical and computer
  engineering, petroleum engineering, physics, and industrial
  engineering. Most similar electives for cross-listed
  undergradaute/graduate credit averaged 10 students in a term, while
  this course averaged 18 per term. Typically, similar electives were
  offered only once in four semesters. This course was popular enough to
  offer each fall semester. There was a drop in graduate enrollment in
  the course in 2020, likely due to COVID-19 induced reductions in the
  overall number of new graduate students in science and engineering
  fields at the university. The course became highly recommended for
  first year graduate students in computational research groups across
  campus and for all first year mechanical and aerospace engineering
  graduate students. Additionally, it was included in the
  interdisciplinary Data Science minor available to undergraduate
  students. The conference proceedings paper detailing the course
  (<xref alt="Ford Versypt, 2019" rid="ref-FordVersypt2019" ref-type="bibr">Ford
  Versypt, 2019</xref>) has been dowloaded from the
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://peer.asee.org/an-interdisciplinary-elective-course-to-build-computational-skills-for-mathematical-modeling-in-science-and-engineering">American
  Society for Engineering Educaion Papers on Engineering Education
  Repository</ext-link> 698 times as of May 1, 2025. In January 2021,
  the authors left the university where the course was developed, and
  multiple faculty reached out to request access to the course materials
  either for offering the course themselves in the future or for sharing
  the materials with their students for self-paced learning. The
  ApplNumComp GitHub repository is already filling that direct need.
  Trainees in the Ford Versypt Lab continue to use the course materials
  for training and examples. The repository has also been disseminated
  through the
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://cache.org/computational-tools-development">Computer
  Aids for Chemical Engineering website</ext-link>. The authors and the
  Computer Aids for Chemical Engineering Corporation trustees have
  discussed how to further disseminate lessons in modular form from
  ApplNumComp into a variety of chemical engineering courses across
  other universities. The authors have already presented these materials
  at conferences for the American Society for Engineering Education and
  the American Institute for Chemical Engineers (AIChE) and a
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.aiche.org/academy/webinars/teaching-computational-skills-chemical-engineers">webinar</ext-link>
  for the AIChE. A workshop was developed for sharing the materials in
  other venues including the 2022 Chemical Engineering Summer School,
  held once every five year for junior faculty. The corresponding
  conference proceedings paper on the workshop
  (<xref alt="Johns et al., 2023" rid="ref-Johns2023" ref-type="bibr">Johns
  et al., 2023</xref>) has been downloaded 581 times as of May 1,
  2025.</p>

  <p>Ashlee N. Ford Versypt developed the Applied Numerical Computing
  course at Oklahoma State University and taught it annually 2016-2020.
  The materials presented here were developed and delivered in a hybrid
  of in-person, online synchronous, and online asynchronous formats in
  Fall 2020. Duncan H. Mullins was a PhD student from Dr.Â Ford Versyptâ€™s
  lab, took the course in Fall 2019, served as a teaching assistant for
  the course in 2020, and aided in conversion of the course to this
  online open-access version.</p>
